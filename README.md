# Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) Toolkit

A security tool designed to monitor a Linux system for suspicious activities and potential intrusions. This HIDS operates by establishing a baseline of the system's normal state and then periodically checking for deviations from that baseline.

Developed as a school project, this HIDS aims to demonstrate fundamental concepts of system security, incident detection, and shell scripting.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Tracks changes to critical system files and directories using `sha256sum`.
* **User Account Monitoring:** Detects the creation, modification, or deletion of user accounts and groups.
* **Log Analysis:** Scans system logs for predefined suspicious keywords.
* **Process & Network Monitoring:** Identifies unusual processes running from suspicious locations (e.g., `/tmp`) and unauthorized open network ports.
* **System Configuration Monitoring:** Monitors changes to critical system configurations like `crontab` entries and SUID/SGID files.
* **Automated Reporting & Alerts:** Generates detailed, timestamped reports and can send email notifications upon detection of suspicious activities.
