# Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) Toolkit

A security tool designed to monitor a Linux system for suspicious activities and potential intrusions. This HIDS operates by establishing a baseline of the system's normal state and then periodically checking for deviations from that baseline.

Developed as a school project, this HIDS aims to demonstrate fundamental concepts of system security, incident detection, and shell scripting.
